# Estimating SVD through Stochastic Gradient Descent  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Calcutate RMSE, Runtime and Memory used for a given dataset and compare for different datasets  
The data is in the form User, Item, Rating, Timestamp  

Please refer the report.pdf for results 

    - RMSE decreases with increase in data count
    - Runtime increases with increase in data count
    - Memory Usage increases with increase in data count
