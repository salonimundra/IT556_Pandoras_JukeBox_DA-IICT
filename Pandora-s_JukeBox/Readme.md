# Music Recommendation System #
Pandora's Jukebox is a personalized music recommendation system based on multi armed bandits with a flavour of content based recommendation. 

* The recommendations are based on the userâ€™s choice of genre and artist. These two are the arms (genre) and subarm (artist) that the user pulls. 
* It is capable of finding songs based on user's past history and preferences. For each genre  a list of three songs is maintained that the user played or played and liked recently and based on this similar songs are recommended.
* It helps to explore different music. It is based on a modified epsilon greedy policy which takes the serendipity factor into consideration. 
* The cold start problem is taken care of by asking the user of his preferences of genre during sign up. 
* It also takes into account the current mood of the user by updating the arms values accordingly.
